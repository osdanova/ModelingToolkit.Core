A library to work with 3D models.

The Core package contains the very basic platform agnostic objects to work with 3D models.

* [ModelingToolkit](https://github.com/osdanova/ModelingToolkit): A tool to process and display 3D models. Note: At the time of writing ModelingToolkit does not use Core but it's inteded that it uses it in the future.

Modeling Toolkit uses Gltf's coordinate system:
